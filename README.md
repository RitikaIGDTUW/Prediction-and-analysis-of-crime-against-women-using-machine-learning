## Abstract  
This research explores trends, patterns, and predictors of crimes against women in India between 2017 and 2022. By leveraging machine learning models, the study identifies high-risk regions and correlates specific socio-economic factors with crime rates. The findings aim to inform policies that enhance women's safety and enable actionable interventions.

## Introduction  
The safety of women remains a critical concern in India, with reported crimes against women increasing yearly. This paper uses predictive analysis to address:  
- Why certain crimes are more prevalent in specific regions.  
- How crime trends evolve over time.  
- What measures can help predict and prevent such incidents.  

---

## Objectives  
- Analyze crime patterns and trends across Indian states.  
- Identify high-risk zones using predictive models.  
- Correlate crime rates with socio-economic indicators such as education, employment, and urbanization.  
- Provide actionable insights to policymakers for targeted interventions.

## Dataset Description  
The study uses crime data from 2017-2022 with the following features:  
- **Crime Categories**: Dowry deaths, human trafficking, domestic violence, sexual assault, cybercrimes, and more.  
- **Geographical Data**: State/UT, districts, urban vs. rural breakdown.  
- **Demographic Data**: Population density, literacy rate, and other socio-economic indicators.  

---

## Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalizing crime rates by population, and encoding categorical variables.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Heatmaps to visualize crime hotspots.  
   - Time series analysis to observe trends.  
3. **Model Development**:  
   - XGBoost, Random Forest Regressor and LightGBM to predict crime rates.  
   - Feature selection to determine key drivers of crime.  
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Relative Improvement in RMSE, accuracy, and F1 score.

## Key Findings  
- **Hotspot Identification**: States like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Rajasthan show consistently high crime rates.  
- **Irregularity During Lockdown**: A significant drop in reported crimes was observed during the COVID-19 lockdown period (2020), likely due to limited mobility and restricted reporting mechanisms, rather than a genuine decrease in crimes.  
- **Population-Adjusted Crime Rates**: When normalized for population, Assam shows unusually high crime rates, which may reflect better reporting mechanisms or unique socio-economic challenges in the region.  
- **Cybercrime Trends**: Significant rise in women-targeted cybercrimes post-2020, attributed to increased internet usage and social media activity.  
- **Predictors of Crime**: Population density, education levels, and socio-economic inequality are strong predictors of crime rates.

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn  
- **Visualization**: Heatmaps, bar charts, pie charts, time series graphs  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation matrices

---

## Future Scope  
- Integrating real-time data from social media and news sources to enhance prediction accuracy.  
- Developing a web-based visualization tool for policymakers and researchers.  
- Including more granular demographic data for deeper analysis.
